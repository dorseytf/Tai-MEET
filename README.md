# Tai-MEET
Model of Ecological Economic Transition in Taiwan

Tai-MEET is a modern ecological economic model that provides a robust testing ground for policies that can enable the transition to a sustainable economy. 

The model brings together cutting-edge approaches from a variety of modeling approaches, including a Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) model of the financial economy, an Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (EEIO) model of the productive economy, and a Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) to measure well-being.
